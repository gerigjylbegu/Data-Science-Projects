# Data-Science-Projects
Thir repository contains a collection of some projects I have made since the start of Turing College.

# How to navigate the repository?

- Each folder constitutes a project. This folder contains the project files.

- Within each folder there is a 3-digit-name makrdown file (e.g 315.md). This file is given by Turing College and it contains the project requirements and the link/information about the source of the dataset that has to be used.

- The Readme file for each project gives a general oultine of what I have done to fulfill the project requirements given by Turing College. Please refer to this file for specific information on the outline of each project and how to run it.
